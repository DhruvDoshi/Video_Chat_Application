## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

With the help of this platform multiple users could have a video chat. This platform doesn't saves any single bit of data on the servers. We only present the video and completely delete it


## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

The platform extracts the data with Webrtc Api and the it connects the users throught that api, continuing with that we are adding multiple modes and filters for the users.

The app is designed to take only 2 users as the time and others will wait their way in the waiting room until the conversation is over.

The entire bot is written in JavaScript

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

The application is hosted over the heruku and the like is listed in the description.


## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+
  - [Python 3](https://python.org/) v3.6+
  - [Git ](https://git-scm.com/) v2.26.0+
  - [pip ](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) v19+
  - [Docker ](https://docs.docker.com/release-notes/) v19.03.8+
 
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
git clone https://github.com/DhruvDoshi/multichat-dhruv
```
```
cd multichat-dhruv
```
```
npm install
```
```
npm start 
```


## üöÄ Deploying your own application <a name = "deployment"></a>

$ heroku create
Creating app... done, ‚¨¢ thawing-inlet-61413
https://thawing-inlet-61413.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/thawing-inlet-61413.git
```

You can use the ```git remote``` command to confirm that a remote named ```heroku``` has been set for your app:
```
$ git remote -v
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/thawing-inlet-61413.git (fetch)
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/thawing-inlet-61413.git (push)
```

#### For an existing Heroku App
If you have already created your Heroku app, you can easily add a remote to your local repository with the ```heroku git:remote``` command. All you need is your Heroku app‚Äôs name:
```
$ heroku git:remote -a thawing-inlet-61413
set git remote heroku to https://git.heroku.com/thawing-inlet-61413.git
```

### Changing your App name on Heroku <a name="changing_your_app_name_on_heroku"></a>
You can rename an app at any time with the ```heroku apps:rename command```. For example, to rename an app named ‚Äúoldname‚Äù to ‚Äúnewname‚Äù, run the ```heroku apps:rename``` command from your app‚Äôs Git repository:
```
$ heroku apps:rename newname
Renaming oldname to newname... done
http://newname.herokuapp.com/ | git@herokuapp.com:newname.git
Git remote heroku updated
```

You can also rename an app from outside of its associated Git repository by including the ```--app``` option in the command:
```
$ heroku apps:rename newname --app oldname
http://newname.herokuapp.com/ | git@herokuapp.com:newname.git
```

**üí° Note:** When you rename an app, it immediately becomes available at the new corresponding ```herokuapp.com``` subdomain (```newname.herokuapp.com```) and unavailable at the old one (```oldname.herokuapp.com```).

If you use the Heroku CLI to rename an app from inside it's associated Git repository, your local Heroku remote is updated automatically. However, other instances of the repository must update the remote‚Äôs details manually.

You can run the following commands to update the remote‚Äôs details in other repository instances:
```
$ git remote rm heroku
$ heroku git:remote -a newname
```

Replace ```newname``` with the new name of the app, as specified in the ```rename``` command.

### Deploying code <a name="deploying_code"></a>
To deploy your app to Heroku, you typically use the ```git push``` command to push the code from your local repository‚Äôs ```master``` branch to your ```heroku``` remote, like so:
```
$ git push heroku master
Initializing repository, done.
updating 'refs/heads/master'
  ...
```
